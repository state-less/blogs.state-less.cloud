# We published our new frontend package *leap-frontend*

We finally extracted some of our code which was reused on various platforms into its own package [@state-less/leap-frontend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@state-less/leap-frontend)

This allows us to make changes to a shared repository and also reduces the size of the other frontend repos.

It also means we finally have a package which provides the open source frontend components by state-less.cloud. The [@state-less/leap-backend]() package is coming soon with the backend code for the forum. 

This allows us to also reduce the code of [state-less/clean-starter](https://github.com/state-less/clean-starter/)
